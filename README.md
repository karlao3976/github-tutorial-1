## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** generally runs around the idea of **version control**. What this means is that it caves ***changes** made   overtime*. Changes based on various commands are able to be tracked because of Git. One thing that doesn’t exist within git is collaboration. Only one person can work on it.

**GitHub** is a website where all your work gets *sent* to a certain **cloud** located there. A **pro** in using GitHub is the ability of **collaboration**. It allows multiple people to work on one repository and send work to each other. This **uses** ***Git***, so it can display the changes being done throughout every commit.

## Initial Setup
The following are instructions on how to create your own Github account...
1. Go to **github.com**
2. Click on **Sign Up** at the top right hand corner of the site.
3. Next, create a **username** and **password**, as well as put in your **HSTAT email**. Your username can be the same as your email.
4. Continue your setup for the Github account.

After, you will have to set up the **SSH feature** in your account. This should only be done **once**. 

It is **important** to do such SSH feature *because* it automatically authorizes you to run your code and display it **efficiently**. This would pretty much speed up your process, since you would no longer have to put in your password in order to verify yourself every time. 

In order to successfully enable this feature, you must do the following steps: 
1. Begin the process by logging into your github account.
2. Next, locate to the **top right hand corner**, where you’ll find your ***profile** icon*. Click on the icon, and then click **Settings** when the list of options appear. Settings should be the **second to last option**.
3. Once you have opened the Settings page, you will see an option that says **SSH and GPG Keys** at the **left sidebar** of the screen. Click on that.
4. When that is done, locate the *green* option that says **New SSH Key** at the **top right hand corner** and click on that.
Once the next page appears, Title it cloud9. As for the key section, do the following:
    * Go to **c9.io** and locate the ***gear** icon* at the **top right hand corner** of the screen, and click on that.
    * Click on the **SSH keys** tab.
    * **Copy** everything that is located in the **second** box, labeled **Connect to your private git repository**.
    * **Paste** all of that copied things into the keys section on the Github page.
6. Click **Add SSH key**.
